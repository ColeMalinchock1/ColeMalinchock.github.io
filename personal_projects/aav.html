            <p class="proj_words">The Autonomous Aquatic Vessel (AAV) Project is to develop a fully autonomous vessel that is capable of traversing a body of water and collecting data on the water. Due to the complexity of the project, it will be separated into three separate phases. Phase I will be to design and manufacture a prototype that has the capabilities of sending and receiving data with an onshore control station via radio frequencies, traveling to designated waypoints, and tracking the temperature of water and the depth at specific points. The onshore control station, a computer that communicates and monitors the vessel from the shore, will also be constructed in Phase I. Phase II will be to design and modify the vessel from Phase I such that it can collect samples that can be tested when it comes back ashore. Phase III will be to design and incorporate a solar panel system that will extend the lifespan of the boat and to reconstruct the hull so that it can withstand harsher bodies of water. </p>
            </br>
            <p class="proj_words">The purpose of this project is to perform an in-depth study of a body of water autonomously. A broader purpose is to gain experience in developing a robotic system that is capable of interacting and traveling in a natural environment.</p>

            <p class="proj_words">The hull of the boat, which is made from fiberglass, resin, and corrugated plastic sheets, was tested in water with a simulated weight inside the hull and had no leaks. Next steps are too: cut excess fiberglass and sand the outside of the hull. Drill the holes for the propellers and mount the motors.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="proj_words">The current software architecture is being developed with ROS2 Foxy. The list of nodes will be: water depth sensor, water temperature sensor, gps and orientation, motor controller, waypoint finder/receiver, rf transceiver.</p>
