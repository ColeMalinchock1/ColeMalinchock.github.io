            <p class="proj_words">The Automated Halo Gravity Traction Project is to develop an automated design to implement onto the current Halo Gravity Traction treatment system that UNC Children's Hospital is currently using for its patients. Read <a href="" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on Halo Gravity Traction treatment. The research is currently in an early generation but will be a proof of concept of how the current system can be automated to prevent doctors from having to manually adjust the tension but to instead have a user-friendly GUI that caretakers and family can use. A mobile phone application will be developed alongside the system so that the doctors are able to constantly monitor the patient when they go home or are outside of the hospital. </p>
            </br>
            <p class="proj_words">The purpose of this project is to provide an easier to use and more technologically advanced system for the patients and their families. This will allow the patient to leave the hospital to go home all while being constantly monitored by the doctors.</p>

            <p class="proj_words">The hull of the boat, which is made from fiberglass, resin, and corrugated plastic sheets, was tested in water with a simulated weight inside the hull and had no leaks. Next steps are too: cut excess fiberglass and sand the outside of the hull. Drill the holes for the propellers and mount the motors.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="proj_words">The current software architecture is being developed with ROS2 Foxy. The list of nodes will be: water depth sensor, water temperature sensor, gps and orientation, motor controller, waypoint finder/receiver, rf transceiver.</p>
